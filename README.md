## Tests

* Describe: Order()
Test: 
      "It should return a Order object with two properties: pizzas and totalcostOfOrder"
Code: 
      currentOrder = new Order();
Expected Output: 
      Order {pizzas: [], totalcostOfOrder: 0}

* Describe: Order.prototype.AddPizza  

Test: 
    "It should add an object with two priorities to the 'pizzas' property of 'order'."

Code: 
      currentOrder = new Order();
      currentOrder.AddPizza("small", ["guts", "something", "gum"]);
      currentOrder.pizzas
Expected Output: 
-   pizzas: [("small", ["guts", "something", "gum"])]

* Describe: Order.prototype.CostOfOrder
Test: 
      "It should add up all the pizzas in that order by adding together each pizza to order.totalCostOfOrder"
Code: 
      currentOrder = new Order();
      currentOrder.AddPizza("small", ["guts", "something", "gum", "nuts"]);
      currentOrder.AddPizza("large", ["something", "gum"]);
      currentOrder.CostOfOrder();
      currentOrder.totalCostOfOrder
Expected Output: 15.5

* Describe: Pizza()
Test: 
      "It should return a pizza object with three properties: size, toppings, and cost"
Code: 
      pizza1 = new Pizza();
Expected Output: 
      pizza {size: "", toppings: [], cost: 0}

* Describe: Pizza.prototype.makeAPizza
Test: 
      "It should add update the current .size and .toppings of the pizza object with the pizzaSize
Code: 
      let pizza1 = new Pizza;
      let pizzaSize = "small";
      let pizzaToppings = ["guts", "something", "gum", "nuts"];
      pizza1.makeAPizza(pizzaSize, pizzaToppings);
      pizza1;
Expected Output: 
      PizzaÂ {size: 'small', toppings: ["guts", "something", "gum", "nuts"], cost: 0}

* Describe: Pizza.prototype.costOfPizza
Test: 
      "It should determine the cost of the pizza based on the size, and the number of toppings." 
Code: 
      let pizza1 = new Pizza;
      pizza1.size = "small",
      pizza1.toppings = ["guts", "something", "gum", "nuts"]
      pizza1.costOfPizza();
      pizza1.cost;
Expected Output: 
      5.5
